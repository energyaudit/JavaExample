/**
 *  If we had 10 different parameters, it would become very difficult to identify what's what in the constructor at a
 *  single glance. To make it worse, some of those values might be optional, which means that we'll need to create a bunch
 *  of overloaded constructors to deal with all possible combinations, or we'll have to pass nulls to our constructor (ugly!).
 * You might be thinking that we can mitigate the issue by calling a no-arg constructor and then setting up the account
 * via setter methods instead. However, that leaves us open to another issue â€“ what happens if a developer forgets to
 * call a particular setter method? We could end up with an object that is only partially initialized, and again, the
 * compiler wouldn't see any problems with it.Thus, there are two specific problems that we need to solve:
 *Too many constructor arguments.
 * Incorrect object state.
 * This is where the Builder pattern comes into play.
