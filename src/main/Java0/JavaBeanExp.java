/*
Must implement Serializable.It should have a public no-arg constructor.
All properties in java bean must be private with public getters and setter methods.
Beans are special type of Pojos. There are some restrictions on POJO to be a bean.
All JavaBeans are POJOs but not all POJOs are JavaBeans.
Serializable i.e. they should implement Serializable interface. Still, some POJOs who donâ€™t implement Serializable
interface are called POJOs because Serializable is a marker interface and therefore not of much burden.
Fields should be private. This is to provide the complete control on fields.Fields should have getters or setters or both.
A no-arg constructor should be there in a bean.Fields are accessed only by constructor or getter setters.
